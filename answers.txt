1.    Describe the following rules in English:

     0 N*x* --> W 0
     1 x**x --> N 2

Starting at state 0, if there's a North wall and a free space on Picobot's West side, regardless of what's east and south of the picobot, it will move West and the state will remain the same.

Starting at state 1, if there's a free space North and South, regardless of what's East or West, the Picobot will move North and set it's state to 2.

2.    What is the difference between the “*” and the “x” in the description of Picobot’s surroundings?

"*"'s represent either a wall or free space, allowing the rules to disregard the type of space the space is. The x, on the other hand, represents a space that doesn't have a wall, and is not blocked. 

3.    Write a Picobot rule that would cause Picobot to crash into a wall (Picobot will report an error if you try this)

0 **** -> E 0

4.    In the Picobot simulator, what will happen if we replace the “X” in the fourth (i.e., last) starting rule with a W. First try to predict, and then run the simulation to see what happens.

By replacing the X with a W, the Picobot was able to move an aditional space West before movign back up, allowing it to cover more ground in a shorter amount of time.

5.    In the Picobot simulator, modify the starting rules so that Picobot moves from East to West instead of from North to South.
# state 0 with nothing W go one step W
0 **X* -> W 0   

0 **W* -> N 1 

1 *x** -> E 1   

1 *E** -> X 0
